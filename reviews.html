                            <p>A friend recommended Cara for laser treatments and injections. I hesitated at first because I was looking to get some light treatments at a Med Spa, and Cara was a Plastic Surgery Center. However, I'm so glad I gave it a try! The staff was well trained and professional. The office was clean and orderly. The staff never tried to upsell me and was informative about the treatment. Even when I asked about other treatments, they were honest about whether I was a good candidate or not. With a AAA quality and service, Cara even offered budget-friendly promotions. Why go to a Med Spa when I can get surgical-center-quality treatments that is competitively priced? It's a win-win for sure. I highly recommend.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Kahng is truly the best there is! I had my rhinoplasty done at Cara Plastic Surgery in Los Angeles, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome! Dr. Kahng and his team were fantastic from day one. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, addressed all my questions, and really understood the look I was going for. The surgery itself went smoothly, and the recovery process was surprisingly easy. The results are exactly what I hoped for--natural and perfectly suited to my face. It has made such a positive impact on my confidence. I'm already considering scheduling a breast augmentation with Dr. Kahng in the near future because I trust his expertise completely. If you're looking for a skilled surgeon with a caring team, I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery! Will be coming back soon!</p>

I am extremely happy with my results. Dr. Kahng took his time explaining the procedure to me and what to expect. He has such good bedside manners. Dr has an amazing staff and all very helpful. Perfection and professionalism is so important and this LA office definitely has that. Thank you all for taking such good care of me.</p>

I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery for anyone looking for top-notch care and results.</p>

                            <p>My first time to the clinic and first time doing the laser toning. I have hyperpigmentation issues and was looking for a mild procedure so that I can go to work the next day without any redness. Nurse Jennifer was very attentive to my needs and provided thorough explanation of how gentle the treatment would be on my skin. I signed up for 10 sessions and started to see the improvement after my fourth visit. The dark areas became lighter and brightened up my overall skin tone though I didn't see much improvement with the fine lines. I'm considering another 10 sessions this fall and will post a review of the results. And get an appt with Grace for facials. She's one of the best!</p>

The staff at Cara were so welcoming and made me feel right at home. After just one session, I could see a noticeable improvement in my skin's texture and tone. I'm really excited to see the results after my next two sessions. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Cara, and I'm very satisfied with the results. Cannot wait for my next appointment!

                            <p>Nurse Jennifer works magic with the Genesis laser! She was recommended to me by my mum (who received the toning laser treatment and I'm sooo happy I went! For context, I'm in my 30's, combination skin, Asian descent. I have lots of light acne scars, redness/rosacea (cheeks), uneven pigmentation, larger pores (nose/cheeks), etc. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Jennifer worked magic! I could tell the difference after just one session, and I couldn't wait for my second. (I got a package of 5 sessions.) She was really kind, thorough, answered all the questions I had before started, and made sure I was comfortable. I literally got compliments on my skin the first week after my treatment! Everything seems brighter, healthier, and more glowy. (I am already budgeting for my next bundle lol) They even provide full, 1-hour long facial afterwards!</p>

                            <p>It's a must for this Center. From the front staff to the nurses to the doctor. I went in for filler (Sculptra) for the first time ever. I was greeted by the front office and then spoke to a consultant named Theresa who then referred me to nurse Julianna. Being my face, I was a little anxious but once Julianna informed me what Sculptra is for and gave me her recommendation, I was all in. Julianna made it so comfortable and answered all my questions. She even noticed I had a lot more volume loss on one side of my face and explained how much I needed and informed me exactly how many cc I would need so my face so it would be even. As soon and she finished, I saw the results immediately. I was so impressed by the change right away. She explained the aftercare and I was so extremely satisfied that I asked if I could add a lip flip. She was very sweet and checked with the front office to make sure my appointment did not over Lap with another. I was able to get my lip flip. I have even made an appointment to come back and discuss additional treatments/ surgeries with Theresa, the consultant. I can't wait to make my next appointment. Thank you Cara for making my Cara (face) look much younger.</p>

                            <p>Where do I begin with my experience with Dr. Kahng?! I had a facelift by him like a little over week ago and I cannot believe how great it already looks!!! He must have a gentle hand because I healed very quickly with very little bruising. I chose him because I was really impressed with his before/ after pictures. He really understands our Asian facial anatomy and has a keen eye to beautify it. I am beyond happy to look in the mirror and see myself as young as I feel. I feel so confident and happy with the way I look now. Julie was the consultant that helped me through the whole process. She made me feel comfortable and confident through it all. She reassured me that everything was going to be fantastic and if I had any questions, she was only a phone call or text away. And I tested her patience many time with lots of stupid questions and she never batted an eye. She replied back and answered all my annoying questions. I hope Dr Kahng realizes what a gem he has. All the nurses were wonderful and this will forever be my place for future procedures. If you are looking for a brilliant surgeon, amazing staff and very reasonable pricing look no further!!! From the very bottom of my heart.... Thank you thank you thank you!!! I am over the moon with my results !!!!</p>

                            <p>I'm doing another review according to how the actual surgery procedure went. So, I ended up deciding to have a surgery procedure done here. The entire process was smooth. All staff that helped me with the process were considerate, kind, and very knowledgable. They eased my nerves before the operation. When I had the consultation with the doctor before the operation and the check up with the doctor after the operation, the doctor proved to show what a great doctor he is. He was articulate in communicating the complications of my case and explained all things well, even during the recovery process of the operation. I trust him if I was to have any more procedures done in the future. Finally, he helped resolve and fix the complications that arose from a previous dissatisfied surgery procedure with another plastic surgeon. That's what mattered the most. Thus, I consider Dr. Kahng to be an intelligent plastic surgeon.</p>

                            <p>Please trust me when I say they are AMAZING! The first time I went was for Botox, was with Vanessa. She was very understanding and not pushy at all (I've had experiences in different locations where they just wanted money instead of my happiness) I got Botox on my forehead and felt so comfortable and extremely happy with my results. While there I asked about fillers for my smile lines and lip filler, which they offer this service, I booked my appointment with Juliana. I was extremely nervous because I had never done fillers. Upon my arrival they were very sweet and patient with me, explained everything and began the numbing process. Juliana was very conservative with how much I should get, that's exactly what I wanted. I did NOT FEEL A THING!! the process was no more than 30-45 min and I am OBSESSED WITH MY FACE!!! They have a customer for life with me! I can't stop looking at myself you will not be disappointed!</p>

I had my eyelids done couple years ago with Dr. Kahng and was very pleased with the results. Couple months back, I decided to do a neck and facelift surgery. I consulted with Dr. Kahng and went under operation. After about 3 months, I can't be happier! I am very happy with the results and once again I can look myself in the mirror again:-) Julie, was my consultant and she was awesome. She walked me through all steps of surgery and post- operations expectations.Overall, Cara Plastic Surgery team was awesome. Everyone at the office is friendly and professional. Dr. Kahng has superb bedside manner. I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery for all your cosmetic needs.</p>

                            <p>I took my husband to Cara for his deep acne scars on face that he had since his teenage years. After counseling he was recommended to do multiple rounds of Secret microneedling for his acne scars. Chemical peel was not something we wanted to try due to its harshness, side effects and long healing time so we were happy to hear about the Secret needling. After each treatment his face was initially red for the first 2-3 days then it got better after that. His acne scars began to lighten noticeably after 2-3 session starting from his forehead and nose. We then extended for another rounds of the Secret needling. Now his overall complexion is cleaner and smoother than before! My husband hates needles and anything painful but the nursing staff here really made each session doable for him. He also noticed the small improvements after each session so he actually wanted to go back for more!! I also get my facials here as well. It is a great deal if you get the package for discount or use one of their monthly specials. I highly recommend you to give this place a try!</p>

I went to him to have botched chin implant/augmentation/removal procedures that I had done with Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. I'm waiting to see if the result(s) here turn out better than Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. Thus far, they treated me with great customer service. Dr. Kahng says he could try improving what's already done to me, and for that, I thank him. It gives me hope there's a plastic surgeon out there who can do a good job.</p>

                            <p>Procedure: mommy makeover on 6/6/23. Can I just say I love this place. From the front desk to the nurses to the anesthesiologist to the doctor. Everyone there is so beyond professional and welcoming it has made this whole experience so much better. The office is always clean and put together. The front desk is so welcoming and friendly. I was assigned Maritza as my coordinator and I can't say enough good things about her. She has been there for me from the very beginning. From answering all my questions to helping me with the financial side of it to even answering me on her days off. She is just absolutely amazing! The nurses Vanessa and Jocelyn just wow. They make everything just so much better. Their knowledge and kindness is something I won't forget. They make me feel so at ease while at the same time keeping it real with how things are going to feel and what to expect. They don't seem to get annoyed when I flinch or ask to many questions. Sorry ladies. Now the day of the procedure. I was so nervous. I was really trying to keep myself calm. The nurse I had (which I wish I could remember her name) was fantastic! She kept me so calm with her jokes and her calm demeanor. Literally the absolute best! Even her aftercare which I remember some of. I remember her just being there for me and very attentive. The anesthesiologist Dr. Ye is a great one to. So informative and really took the best care of me. I felt sick waking up but once they gave me medicine for it I was perfectly fine. He did fantastic. Shoutout to the OR tech also because they don't get enough shoutouts. Finally Dr. Kahng. He is great. I love how calm and relaxed he is. I told him how I wanted to look natural and not have big breast implants. They are still swollen but I'm so happy with the results so far. He really took what I said and listened. There are really not enough words to express my gratitude to each and everyone at this office who made this process so smooth and easy. I would recommend you guys over and over again.</p>

                            <p>I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr. David Kahng! One year post op (breast aug) and I am beyond satisfied with my results. I sought many consultations before deciding to move forward with this procedure and that was in large part after seeing Dr. Kahng and learning everything I needed to know about the process. All of my questions were answered, I felt so comfortable from start to finish, and I felt very in control and in the loop with everything big to small. You need to have trust and good communication for a surgery like this and they knocked it out of the park. Also... JULIE! She is the best, she made me feel like an absolute queen the entire year long journey. So kind, sweet and caring - actually this goes for the entire staff! Everyone was always so helpful and welcoming. There is a lot that goes into this procedure - many pre op appointments, post op care, and follow ups through the first year of recovery. Honestly any time I had to go in for a check up or appointment, I looked forward to it! I knew it would be a good experience. Best of luck to anyone considering this journey - I am so glad I did and with CARA / Dr. Kahng!</p>

                            <p>Cara is definitely my ultimate place to go for my beauty enhancements. The office is super clean, the staff is very welcoming and friendly. As well as all the nurses in the office. Nurse Vanessa did an amazing job on my lips she's been doing my lips for the past 3 years including my Botox. I love that she is very self explanatory with every step that she is doing, very clean and most important professional and knowledgeable with the face anatomy. I know I chose the right place. Thank you everyone at Cara. Can't wait for dr kahng to do my BBL.</p>

                            <p>People have been asking about my experience with dr. kahng, so i thought i would just post about it. My experience was super smooth, throughout the whole process. everyone at the clinic was super nice (julie was my consultant, love her), including the doctor himself. he holds himself with a quiet confidence, and was clear and honest about what my expectations should be. just overall a very pleasant person. Surgery day came and i was NERVOUS but the nurses were so kind and made sure to ask if i had any questions. almost 3 hrs later, i was wheeled out to the car. after the 30 min drive home, i was ready to walk around and talk. there was no pain throughout the healing process-- at least in my experience. the first night was the most unpleasant, because i had to get used to breathing through my mouth. but after 2 days, i could stop using a drip pad, and halfway through the first week they had me come in for a gentle cleaning. you do not do any of the cleaning yourself!!! no peroxide, no saline, only water and q-tips for blood that dried outside the nose. they will do the cleaning for you. i got it cleaned 3 days post, 1 week post, and 2 weeks post. I did not have any significant swelling or bruising after the surgery. obviously, my nose is swollen, but i didn't look like i had two black eyes at any point. no one at the clinic seemed surprised at this-- i truly think dr. kahng is just hella good at his job. The full cost included anesthesia and post surgery visits, which i was glad to hear. (AND A STEROID SHOT they give u in the first week post op!) my swelling is going down slowly but surely! even though i'm only a couple weeks out, i'm still very pleased with the results (i got the bridge shaved, the sides slimmed, and cartilage added to the tip (he uses donor cartilage)). Overall, i can't recommend him enough, especially for asian clients. :)</p>

                            <p>I had 3 surgeries done with Dr. David Kahng. My health journey started when I decided to change my life 6 years ago and live healthier. I have change my mind to live happier and peaceful which has ultimately affected my physique, I had lost the volume of my breast and had a lot of loose skin on my stomach. I decided to get treatment to complete my transformation. The first thing that I would like to talk about is the vibe of the office, everybody was very sweet and professional. I would like to give a shout out to Maritza that helped me through the consultation process and Vanessa the beautiful nurse that helped me with my pre op and post op. Even after my procedure they were standing by through my healing process. Dr. Kahng did a wonderful job on my Breast, tummy tuck and my nose! I highly recommend anybody that would like to enhance their body. Thank you Dr. Kahng and all the beautiful team</p>

                            <p>I was kind of nervous coming here but came in on my friends recommendation and I think I've found my go to spot for all things beauty! The waiting room is clean and I didn't have to wait long at all (maybe 10-15 min). My consultant, Julie, was super helpful/insightful and made sure to answer every one of my billion questions (I brought a list). I especially appreciated that she didn't just try to sell me every package that they had and even talked me out of things that I thought I needed. My nurse's name was Alice (I think) and she was just as amazing. I was really nervous at first but she was able to calm me down by explaining everything. I got the skin booster treatment and Botox. It's only been a week and I can already see the results!</p>

                            <p>I found Dr. David Kahng through a friend who had a lot of positive words to say about him. I was tempted to get rhinoplasty for over a decade. I flu from New York for consultation and after having the meeting I was more at ease. Dr. Kahng did an amazing job during my consultation answering every question and I left. He explained in detail what he can do and I showed what I want my new nose to look like. It has been only two months and I can definitely see that he's done a great job and he did exactly as promised and I'm very happy with the result. Given it will look even better few months down the road. His team of nurses were very attentive and helpful at every step. The medical facility is very clean and a professional environment. The recovery was short for me and painless. All my questions and concerns were answered in a timely fashion, I was never rushed at any time and my results are amazing. I'm glad I made the trek to Los Angeles and very happy when I look in the mirror. I'm very thankful to Dr. Kahng and I hope he helps more women/men to feel and look even more confident. I was extremely satisfied with the professionalism of the staff. Dr. Kahng is an exceptional surgeon whom I would highly recommend to anyone!</p>

Second time coming here for botox, and didn't feel pressured to get more than I wanted. Suggestions were made, but my decision was respected and followed through. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend this clinic for your cosmetic needs!  It's super clean. I've had a different nurse both times, and both were nice. Vanessa and Alice.</p>

He was already known from Korean community in Los Angeles that he is good at rhinoplasty, so I trusted him already. After a consultation with him, I trusted him more and now I'm happy with my new look. I only regret that I didn't get it done sooner! Every staff was super friendly and welcoming also.

                            <p>I have been coming to CARA center since Early June and I have to say that it has been a game changer for my skin. My skin has significantly improved, my face is more toned, my skin is hydrated, my skin is glowing, my hyperpigmentation has decreased. I had a series of Miin lasers and facials and rejuran injection. Before my treatments I was experiencing severe dryness and dullness but these treatments have significantly helped. CARA staff, Vee, nurse Umi, nurse Alice, nurse heather & the aesthetician have been extremely professional and experts. Believe me when I say I have severe trust issues when it comes to trusting places/people especially to treat my face. But this place was highly recommend and they have really exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend them.</p>

I never regret one thing about my rhinoplasty, I just wish I would have done it sooner. I got so many compliments on my nose as I refer them to Doctor. As a girl, being pretty is something we all want. When we look good, we feel good. The new look I have completely change my self-esteem. I became so much more confident and love myself even more.

                            <p>I recent have my Rhinoplasty here with Doctor Kahng... I love my new nose each n every day since I did it over one month ago... I'm glad I found the best doctor who is very very extreme gentle and I got so many compliments from friends, coworkers & relative that my new nose look extreme natural, and also it helps my face look longer and less rounded... best thing is that I love the result which I did not expect it...Also, thumb up to miss Julie, she keep checking on me after the surgery to make sure everything went well...in near future, if I have any other plans for cosmetic improvements, I would definitely choose doctor Kahng...</p>

                            <p>Hi here's an update on fully healed eyelids! My right eye is naturally smaller than my left eye and has more skin/fat on the lid, so after the surgery, the asymmetry is still present. I feel like suture method isn't as good as the surgical method at correcting asymmetry, but who knows. But I'm loving the results, it's been two years post op and I love how they've healed! It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want a big lid, I wanted a natural lid to maintain the mono lid look a little bit. This is what I told Dr. kahng and I think he did great to honor my preference. Be sure to tell him what you want!!</p>

        <p>I've been wanting a rhinoplasty for several years now and finally decided to go through with it! I called 8 different plastic surgery centers between LA, OC, and SD. I had the best first impression over a phone consult with Julie at CARA, which led me to booking an in-person consult with the doctor. I had phone/virtual consults with other doctors/surgery centers that just spat out pricing info without wanting to get to know me and what my desires were, which was concerning to me. The entire staff here has been so friendly and helpful, I also appreciate how Julie emails me back quickly whenever I have questions. My surgery date is booked for later this month and I couldn't be more excited! Julie has really made this so easy for me, I'd recommend anyone give them a call if you're interested in one of their procedures!</p>

Completely quick and easy procedure. It was exactly what I wanted. I would highly recommend this doctor. Sweet doctor that really cares for his patients.</p>

        <p>As a male customer, I felt a bit intimidated asking questions about skincare. On the day of my appt at San Gabriel -Clinic, everyone was so kind and very respectful. they took time to listen and took care of my treatment. The greatest thing I like about this place: they are very honest and so kind. I can see they love what they do and they make sure you are fully satisfied with your treatment. Alice was my nurse. she's amazing, kind, and very skillful. Dr. Kahng and his staff here are very professional, they make you feel very welcome. The clinic is very clean and I can see they follow infection control protocol every well. I honestly recommend this clinic and I will come back very soon for my next treatment. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I had a wonderful experience with Cara's staff, nurses, and Dr. Kahng. The procedure went very smoothly and comfortably. Staff was accessible and communicative all throughout the process and was/will be available via text post-op to answer any questions or concerns.</p>
        <p>I'm very happy with my results, which I expected given Dr. Kahng is an expert in his field!</p>
        <p>Procedure: male Asian rhinoplasty.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kahng and his associates are such wonderful people. What drew me to this facility as opposed to its competitors is the welcoming vibe that I sensed from the first interaction. There was another doctor I considered but I chose Dr. Kahng because he has a calm, welcoming, and non-judgmental demeanor. I think with any beauty service, it's common to feel vulnerable so for me personally, I prioritized trusting my gut feeling. So far I'm glad I went with CARA. <br />Two front office assistants and the nurse I have interacted with all have been so lovely. <br />I knocked off one star because there are times that I feel Dr. Kahng is rushed and the last time I spoke with the front desk person she sounded a bit annoyed. However, 9/10 times my experience has been positive so a 4-star review seems reasonable at this time. <br />The last thing I'd like to mention is that IMHO, CARA has conveyed ethnic diversity and acceptance of everyone regardless of skin color, race, and/or gender. <br />I am making this statement based on the 3+ visits I've had so far.</p>

        <p>I got my boobs done at Cara, and I have to say that I love Dr. Kahng and the entire team! I wanted to wait a little while till after the procedure to see how the healing goes and what the scars are like. I'm shook because the scars are barely there! The healing is going well, and Dr. Kahng is a master of making the breasts look so natural! This was my first time getting any kind of procedure done, so I was nervous. Everything changed after the first consultation. The entire process was so smooth. Everyone at the office was warm and welcoming. Dr. Kahng listened to everything and answered all my questions, and I trusted him completely going in. I was also planning on getting a Brazilian Buttlift done and I already know where I'm going to get that done!</p>

        <p>This place is so nice and clean and professional. Alice was my nurse and was very honest with me. I wanted extra units for my forehead, but she discouraged me, saying that i didn't need as much. I'm really grateful she was being honest and not just trying to make extra money off me I had my crows feet done, and I feel like I look 5 years younger! Thanks Alice!</p>

        <p>Great service and care all around.</p>
        <p>I'm so satisfied with my results. Everyone is so nice and efficient.</p>
        <p>I read reviews complaining for consultation and prices before going to this office but I gave them a try since most reviews were good.</p>
        <p>My first visit with consultant Julie, she was very honest, knowledgeable, caring and sweet. She always tells the truth. It worth it than any other clinics. And I got treatment that really helped, it was not a waste of money.</p>
        <p>Also staffs are nice and friendly, Nurses are very informative.</p>
        <p>I definitely come back here for another treatment</p>

        <p>I have been coming here along with some family members for the past couples of years for laser treatments. I have had treatments in all the offices Dr. Kahng operates and have only positive experiences every time I come in. Everyone from the front desk clerk to the RNs along with the consultants have been nothing but welcoming to me. The consultants explain in detail exactly how each treatment is helping my skin and the aftercare I would expect. I have extremely sensitive skin and I love how the RNs do a great job by being very gentle and comforting. Especially now with this pandemic going on, it feels great knowing people are still very particular and take pride in their customer service !</p>

        <p>Lengthy review up ahead:<br />Where to begin with CARA Plastic Surgery Center...Dr. Kahng literally changed my life for the BETTER!<br />I wanted a BBL (Brazilian butt lift) since I was 16 and for my 23rd birthday this year I looked for a surgeon that does BBL's near my home and that was when I came across CARA Plastic Surgery Center on Yelp. I was impressed by their positive reviews so I looked through their website and photo galleries. I immediately contacted them for a virtual consultation and they responded back the very next hour! :)<br />After the virtual consultation I was set on going through with the BBL procedure. All the nurses and doctors I have spoken to have been nothing but professional and kind. They of course follow all the new COVID-19 rules and are extremely patient with you. I'm so happy I chose CARA for my first surgery and they left me with very natural looking results. :) They answer any and all questions you have as well as demonstrate how to put on the compression garment and faja you will need (both came for free).<br />All in all you won't regret coming here and I cannot thank everyone enough at this center for being accommodating and helpful throughout the whole process. Thank you once again and I will definitely recommend this surgery center to my friends and family.</p>

        <p>The best experience ever!!! Maritza and all the girls were so amazing... they made the whole process so much easier for me. I was nervous but they relieved my stress. They took their time and followed all Covid-19 requirements. I'm two weeks post op and my results are amazing. Dr Kahng does fantastic work...the incision lines are precise and my figure is amazing and I'm two weeks post... I can't wait until swelling goes down to reveal my true figure. I would recommend the team without a doubt!!! If I could give 10 stars I would!!!</p>

        <p>Dr Kahng is an awesome Dr! He does a great job. I'm absolutely happy with his work. I had a tummy tuck about 4years ago and I can say I'm happy with the results. I came back for a leg tuck last month and the results are coming along very well. The office staff is awesome too. I'm able to call or text Maritza 24hrs 7days a week for any questions or concerns and she replies to me right away. I would absolutely recommend Dr Kahng to anyone that's looking for a Plastic Surgeon. That's why I referred my daughter to him when she told me she wanted to get a Breast Augmentation. So she did her research and choose him to do her surgery. She had her surgery in May and she's in love with her new look. Thank you Dr Kahng and staff!</p>

Vannessa is my girl for my Botox and lips, she's awesome so getting her scheduled with me is sometimes rough since I have a busy life myself. The staff here set me up with the Brilliant Distinctions App and I had two offers that I wanted to redeem on my lip filler that I always purchase. Well Ve mad It very easy over text to get my discounts used. She also really worked with the days I gave her that I was available to get my services done. Ve was sweet, organized, and text me back fast! I love It ! The staff here is unmatched by any other office I've been to. Keep up the good work Ve(:</p>

        <p>I went to CARA for a botox service that I needed. Nurse Vanessa helped me out with this procedure, she was very knowledgeable about the anatomy of the facial muscles and where not to inject after asking me where exactly I wanted botox units. I proceed to let her know of my previous revision rhinoplasty that I had performed on me about 18 months ago and all my concerns I had before getting injected near that area. Vanessa was very patient and listened to all my concerns and knew exactly what she was doing and advised me what would be the best option. I am so pleased with the procedure and very happy with the results. I am going to continue to come in for botox with nurse Vanessa, her injections were done very gently with little to no pain, she was amazing!</p>

        <p class="date">4/2/2020</p>
        <p>I have monolids and have been wanting eyelid surgery for a long time. I've done many consultations with various plastic surgeons around Los Angeles, but never felt like any of them were a good fit. However, when I did a consultation with CARA plastic surgery in SG, I immediately felt like the staff truly cared about my needs. The consultant, V, spent a long time with me explaining the surgery, pricing, risks and benefits of different procedures, and answered all of the questions I had. She even gave me her phone number and I've texted her many times with questions that she responded to immediately. Because of this, I felt very comfortable moving forward with the procedure. I wanted the suture method but another doctor had previously told me that I did not have the right anatomy for suture method. During my consult with Doctor Kahng, he seemed very knowledgeable and assessed me and was confident that his three minimal suture method would work for me. It's been 2 months post procedure and I am SO happy with the results. it exceeded my expectations!! Initially the swelling lasted for around a week, and one eye had bruising for 2 weeks, but they recommended home remedies that worked wonderfully for both bruising and swelling! There were no other complications . They scheduled follow up appointments and I felt like the quality of care continued on even after the surgery. I would highly recommend Cara plastic surgery to anyone. Ive attached photos below of my healing process hi hi</p>

        <p>This office is very friendly and they know what they're doing! I went in for botox--for the frown line and a small amount on forehead. Their office is beautiful, very clean and nicely designed. Everyone said hello to me and greeted with a smile. I loved that. The woman who performed my botox was wonderful and listened to the concern I had. Highly recommend--this will be my new spot for botox and possible fillers in the future.</p>

        <p>I'm usually wary of medical services..especially of this nature..and especially korean places because I just assume they are money hungry (I'm also Korean by the way). <br />The issues I wanted addressed were acne scars I've unfortunately been left with from severe teenage acne..and some from adulthood. <br /><br />I'd like to say that my entire experience here has been nothing short of wonderful. Julie, who was my consultant, was patient, kind, and understanding. She didn't shove any services to my face...instead she suggested what she believed were best treatment options to me and at very reasonable costs (I visited a dermatology office before this and the prices were just outlandishly expensive). <br />I felt no burden onto her whatsoever as I was talking my mouth off...of my acne history, bad experiences with dermatologists, price concerns, and ineffective treatments. Again, her patience was much appreciated. Thank you Julie. I was then greeted by such an angel of a person....Alice, who was going to treat me. I naturally have high anxiety and stress easily...but she genuinely made me feel really comfortable. She also took the time to explain things I didnt know about certain aspects of acne...and she inspected me very closely to further explain what sort of corrections I can have...and preventative measures I can take to better manage my skin. <br />Nothing felt painful and she did this cute thing where she would warn me before every time she would initiate the treatment on the problematic spots. Alice... you are so kind, thank you. <br />I already see improvements and it's only been a few hours. Dr. Kahng... I would like to say you definitely hired professional and interpersonal individuals to be part of your staff. <br />Please give them a raise or treat them out to Kang Ho Dong next door ^_^; <br /><br />I'm going to come back for other issues I want corrected. JULIE AND ALICE...YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!</p>

        <p>This place is phenomenal! Both my mom and I have been coming here for all of our cosmetology needs. The front desk staff is welcoming and very pleasant. Maritza the consultant is amazing! She's very knowledge, personable and makes the process enjoyable. Vanessa is awesome with Botox! Personally I've received Botox injections as well as laser treatments for dark spots. Both worked so well. I refer everyone I know here because I know they're going to get outstanding results. Friends and family of received :breast augmentation, Brazilian butt lift, neck tightening, tummy tucks, eyelid rejuvenation, Botox and laser hair removal to name a few. They have all LOVED the results! Excited for my next appointment for laser hair removal!</p>

        <p>I had an amazing experience here. I got a breast augmentation about a week ago. First off my consultation was wonderful. I was never rushed and had all my questions answered. The staff was so nice and the nurses were very informative. Dr. Kahng did my surgery and I went in completely calm because I felt I can truly trust him. In a blink of an eye my surgery was over. Any questions post op I had were answered promptly. I felt extremely well taken care of. My mom came with me to my surgery and she said bedside manner was a 10/10 and she is a hard to please woman lol. Over all I enjoyed my time with the staff and nurses and loved my results so far.</p>

        <p>Been with CARA a while now and this is a long overdue review that I have been telling myself to do it as this is the only way to pay gratitude to Dr. Kahng, Vanessa, Dasol and Ve! Words can't express how I am so grateful to have find Dr. Kahng and of course through Yelp! I first came in for a consult for rhinoplasty infection done in another office (I will not mention names here) During my first consultation, Dr. Kahng took his time explaining on how and what might have happened that cause the infection. Ve is so helpful answering and replying to all my text (I was so paranoid due to my first experience, I want to make sure this is the RIGHT place to go) I decided to proceed my procedure with Dr. Kahng (Best choice ever, no I am not exaggerating). From my first impression booking for a consultation to getting the surgery done and coming back for follow ups, everyone is so welcoming and helpful! Nurse Vanessa and Dasol has been helping me throughout my recovery, they are always so patient and polite! I am 3 months out from my surgery and *finger crossed* everything is healing well! Thank you Team CARA!</p>

        <p>Ye~~ This place is so awesome! I got the Ulthera care 2 weeks ago for the first time. Very nervous... but every staff is very professional and gently nice. So I got the treatment comfortablely. And I also got the whitening premium service yesterday. It was very impressive and effective to get my face tone lightened up. Today morning, my face is very clean and soft. Their price is also very reasonable. I really love this place! I will tell all my friends to get this sevice.</p>

        <p>Being close to 40, you have to worry about your skin sagging and horrific lines showing up on your face. Sorry but those $2000 face creams really don't help much to erase those worry lines and sad sad wrinkles.</p>
        <p>I had an amazing plastic surgeon/friend who first did Botox on me at UCLA, but with the distance and I know he would rather do reconstructive breast surgery from cancer than simply inject me.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I yelped and yelped and found CARA. I wanted somewhere closer to me with great reviews and good pricing. When I called, it was easy to make an appointment and the ladies were so kind.</p>
        <p>I came in and the office on the day of my appointment and it was so nice, clean and presentable. The ladies were so kind at the front desk, filled out some forms and within 5 minutes, I was called in.</p>
        <p>Alice, the RN, was the one who injected me with Botox. Before the injections, she studied my face and asked what concerned me most. She was so thorough and yes, I am still nervous with the needles, but she was so calm and took her. We discussed what areas needed the injections and before she proceeded, she gave me an ice pack which tremendously helped for my face. Oh do I love that ice pack! Then, all the many tons and tons of injections were done without pain. It was amazing and Alice was amazing. I literally had no pain and did not wince for her skills are so smooth and professional.</p>
        <p>The prices are so reasonable and with her skills, would I be back? Yes. To Botox and youth, yes.</p>
        <p>Updated Review 10/11/2019:</p>
        <p>So I came back today to have Botox again with Alice, the RN and right away, with no waiting, she was already there waiting for me!</p>
        <p>I LOVE that she gave me ice packs for my face to hold on to, so that it helps with the bruising and injections. Her injections are so precise and not painful at all! She really knows what she is doing. We first go over what areas I want to get done and she truly listens and understands my problem areas.</p>
        <p>It was so quick and easy and no bruising! This place is truly reasonable and wonderful for botox injections. Their pricing is so fair and making the appointment is so easy. The office staff are so friendly and the entire clinic is so modern, clean and neat.</p>
        <p>There is parking in the back of 3rd Street or front meter parking $1/hr.</p>

        <p>I love the treatments and the results! As I am getting toward 50's, I have noticed some aging signs like wrinkles and sagging skins on my face. My biggest concern was my laugh lines were getting more pronounced. It really bothered me and I even lost confidence too. I decided to get Botox and filler. It was my first time having it, so I was little worried and scared until I met my beauty consultant, Clara and a nurse. They were very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. They recommended me minimal treatments as I am a starter. I only got 1 syringe of Juvederm for my laugh lines and 10 units of Botox for my eye wrinkles. As soon as filler was placed, I could see the difference on my face. I was impressed to see such a fast result. Botox would take about a week to see the results. Now I look more refreshed, vibrant and young. I am very happy about results and will definitely return in the future. I recommend the treatment to everyone who is thinking of the treatment of Botox and filler. Also, it wasn't painful if you are scared of needles.</p>

        <p>I've gotten multiple treatments of Botox and Filler with the nurses here and it was amazing and this has led me to proceed with cosmetic surgery here! I have been tempted since after pregnancy with Liposuction and also Breast Augmentation. I knew this will be the best decision, it has been 1 year since my surgery and the results are amazing. I also went to get a second opinion at other offices and they told me I needed a breast lift. But Dr. Kahng proceed and told me an implant will be sufficient to give me a lift, I went with his decision and he also told me I do not need a Tummy tuck since I do not have a lot of sagging skin. We went ahead and proceeded with a stomach, flanks and arm lipo. Nurses are very supportive throughout my recovery and during my follow ups. I have also been very religious on putting on my compression garment throughout my recovery. Overall, I am very satisfied and without doubt be rating this place 7 out of 5 starts</p>

        <p>LOVE! I am so impressed with this place. I was looking for a place for botox but didn't want to just go to a med spa being a newby to injections etc. SO I did a TON of research and CARA won my business b/c they have all the proper certifications, it's an actual plastic surgery office so anyone performs a procedure is a doctor or nurse. Their prices are about 30% less than the top Beverly Hills surgeons offices so that is what really made me move forward with booking them. Also- the reviews are amazing so I figured with great reviews, fair prices (not high not too skeptically low), convenient location, easy parking, and it being a surgeons office I would give it a go. Also they were very easy to communicate w/on the Yelp app- so fast and open and didn't just force me to make a consultation.</p>
        <p>When I arrived I had a consult with Ve, she's really great- VERY straight forward does not try to up sale at allllllll. Straight forward while letting you know options but being honest with what will give the best results. I wanted to get botox in my masseter / jaw to slim my face. first of all- every place i called while doing my research said i will need 25 units per side. Ve examined my jaw and recommended 15 for one side and 10 for the other bc it was smaller. I was already impressed that they werent just giving me a general dose amount and actually was trying to save me from spending money if i didnt need to (bc of that i will always come back here so pls never change that value). So something i thought was going to be closer to $500 was closer to $300- big savings and i believe it was $9 unit which is great compared to $14 unit at some offices I called before. Ve answered all my questions and i was able to discuss other treatments i was considering and she gave great advice.</p>
        <p>Nurse Dasol performed the procedure and omg I LOVE HER! SO nice and SO patient and gentle and normal and funny and just so warm, cant speak highly enough! Really trusted her immediately.</p>
        <p>I was happy with the botox results and decided to go back to Cara for Kybella, of course booked it with Nurse Dasol and it felt like i was visiting a friend! She was so excited to see me and so excited to do kybella on me b/c she really believed in the product and knew I would have great results. It seriously felt like a trusted nurse friend was giving me the procedure, i was so comfortable. She was very honest with what to expect and made sure to give me extra time with numbing cream to ensure the highest level of comfort. It felt like she really gave me a custom treatment based on my concerns, she really listened and cared. She is so refreshing, if you can book with NURSE DASOL (for any treatment) you wont be disappointed, she is smart and so kind and you will immediately trust her. Again, she was all about not having me waste money so we did two vials (again, very fair price) and with out a doubt I have seen results. i went in for a follow up and they took a great before and after pic. I will get another round of treatment mostly because I saw real results and just want to maximize the potential of the treatment. It wasnt as painful as I thought it would be but it def has some discomfort but just grit through it, i started seeing result within a week and a half, for sure was bull frog swollen for 3 days but then was back to normal. the area will feel funky for about 4-6 weeks but kybella WORKS!</p>
        <p>I will always come here for any treatment large or small. Ve and Nurse Dasol spoke SOOO highly about the surgeon as well so I already trust him and havent even worked with him yet HAH! all the other staff was so nice and friendly. The office is very cute, modern and clean. The building they are in looks a little rough but their office unit is very very nice. there is free parking in the back in a secure lot with a security guard.</p>
        <p>Also, side note, I came in for kybella but was on a unique prescription drug- and even though it was safe to do the procedure it could have effected the results so they wouldn't perform the procedure on me until i was off that medicine because they didnt want me to waste my money- i was bummed but honestly impressed and grateful! Very happy they made me wait and do it right. serious integrity goes very far with me esp for stuff like this! SO yes LOVE THEM, go here- you wont regret it- they are mindful and very professional and very fair and very clean.</p>

      <p>I love being tan and being outdoor so it was no surprise that my face has quite a bit dark spots as a result of sun damage. I was told laser treatment would help remove the sun damage. Having never had a laser treatment, I was quite nervous and doubtful of the treatment. During the consultation, I was advised to do the revlite that promised to remove or diminish the dark sun spots. Alice was my nurse who did all five treatments. She was kind, gentle and very nice. Each treatment lasted approximately 45 minutes. It started with zaps all over the face, then cooling and then a relaxing mask. All in all, a painless and fast treatment that promised significant results.</p>
      <p>I have not really noticed much difference since I look at myself every day. However, my husband and daughter said that my face looks much lighter, clearer and the dark spots appear to be lighter. A big thanks to Alice!</p>

      <p>Being close to 40, you have to worry about your skin sagging and horrific lines showing up on your face. Sorry but those $2000 face creams really don't help much to erase those worry lines and sad sad wrinkles.</p>
      <p>I had an amazing plastic surgeon/friend who first did Botox on me at UCLA, but with the distance and I know he would rather do reconstructive breast surgery from cancer than simply inject me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I yelped and yelped and found CARA. I wanted somewhere closer to me with great reviews and good pricing. When I called, it was easy to make an appointment and the ladies were so kind.</p>
      <p>I came in and the office on the day of my appointment and it was so nice, clean and presentable. The ladies were so kind at the front desk, filled out some forms and within 5 minutes, I was called in.</p>
      <p>Alice, the RN, was the one who injected me with Botox. Before the injections, she studied my face and asked what concerned me most. She was so thorough and yes, I am still nervous with the needles, but she was so calm and took her time. We discussed what areas needed the injections and before she proceeded, she gave me an ice pack which tremendously helped for my face. Oh do I love that ice pack! Then, all the many tons and tons of injections were done without pain. It was amazing and Alice was amazing. I literally had no pain and did not wince for her skills are so smooth and professional.</p>
      <p>The prices are so reasonable and with her skills, would I be back? Yes. To Botox and youth, yes.</p>

      <p>This is a very long due review but I wanted to make sure everything was good before posting because plastic surgery is pretty scary and permanant. I came to CARA because my eyelid fold was very uneven. I did not want to get double eyelid surgery and Dr. Kang understood and suggested that I get a fat injection in the eyelid to even the lines out. The procedure went very smoothly and a the staff were very kind and helpful. At first, I was very pleases by my results but as time passes, the fat decreased and my eyelids became uneven again. While this worried me, Dr. Kang assured me that this was all part of the process and if even after a year, if I was unhappy with my results, he would re-do the procedure for me free of cost. Now, almost 1 year later, my eyes look very natural and although they are not 100% even, I am still very happy with my results! I Highly recommend CARA.</p>

      <p>My mother's friend referred her to Dr Kahng, she had a tummy tuck and breast implants about two years ago and her results are awesome. So since I liked her results I decided to have a tummy tuck which I was contemplating for the past 10 years. It has been two months since I had the surgery and I'm beyond happy with the nurses they are really nice, very patient and answer all your questions. Since the first time I had my consultation I had a good feeling about the doctor and knowing my mom looked great, I said this is the place to be Dr Kahng is awesome and I always see him for my post op even though I know he is busy with other patients. I'm really excited for the summer to come and wear a cute bikini which I never wore in my life. I couldn't have asked for more perfection than how my belly looks and my scar is really thin. I highly recommend Dr Kahng he is the best!</p>

      <p>After years of using creams and serums to turn back the signs of aging, I finally came to the realization that more drastic measures were required to help me get the results I wanted. What I wanted was to tighten my jawline and improve skin elasticity. After years of viewing Youtube videos and researching different procedures, I decided that Ultherapy was what I needed. Yes, this is what all the celebs are getting including Christy Brinkley.</p>
      <p>Came here after reading great Yelp reviews of the place.</p>
      <p>Met with Marie for a consultation, got the details, and made an appointment in December. I was informed that the procedure was painful (that was the general consensus based on my research), and she recommended that I get a Demerol shot in addition to the face numbing cream. At first I resisted the idea of getting a shot, but changed mind in the end. And boy, am I glad that I did. I didn't feel any pain except in few places, and it was pretty searing. Can't imagine doing this without the shot and topical (THANK YOU, Marie!). Nurse Alice is a pro, the whole process took about 2 hours including the shot and face numbing cream to take effect.</p>
      <p>It's only been a month, but I am thrilled with the result. It's subtle, but the improvement is undeniable. I've been told that it will only get better in the next few months, and I can't wait!</p>
      <p>Now that I've entered the age where my vanity is overshadowing and outweighing my fear of getting "procedures", I'm so glad that I found this place. Staff, friendly and efficient; transaction/service, straight forward; and the result, to my satisfaction. What more can you ask for?!</p>

      <p class="date">1/12/2019</p>
      <p>It's been almost a full month since my full body liposuction surgery. I had a lot of ups and downs during this short 4-5 weeks after my two-day liposuction surgeries. I would say I suffered quite abit because i didn't really have ample rest before I started vacaying with my family to Vegas and all over LA. (I'm not from the states) it was really like living hell....... (story continues later if you would like to read on)</p>
      <p>[ CUSTOMER SERVICE ]</p>
      <p>From pre ops to post ops, however, Dr Khang and team of clinic staff have made me greatly satisfied with their full fletched customer service. Not only are they professional, everyone treats me with care and concern sincerely, so much that my heart always feels full when I go in for check ups.</p>
      <p>[ OPERATION DAYS ]</p>
      <p>Day 1, I had Angie as my dedicated nurse. She was very easy to talk to and was very good at her work as a nurse even though. Very beautiful smile too!</p>
      <p>Day 2, I had Wendy as my dedicated nurse. Very experienced at her work, she makes me feel that I'm in safe hands.</p>
      <p>[ STORY OF MY SUFFERING: EXTENDED DOWNTIME / re: POST SURGERY SERVICE ]</p>
      <p>So you know usually people take about a week to recover and resume to their daily routine. I thought it will be for me too but no.</p>
      <p>I took about 6 days off to rest and nurture my health and body, keep my legs elevated and stayed in bed all day, before I went Vegas for vacation for Christmas. I was getting better but still couldn't really walk and I was swollen to a bigger size than before surgery. I really took rest for granted and because I didn't really heed dr Kahng's advice, my body gave way.</p>
      <p>2 weeks into post ops, I suffered an infection in my right leg and it was really terrible I almost died one night because I was short of breath, head was spinning and my leg veins had sharp pain whenever I sat with pressure on them thighs.</p>
      <p>I quickly messaged Ve, my consultant who I have been liasing with even before I met Dr Khang in person. She told me that was very serious, even though I have Long passed the post ops review period, I should be fine and healthy recovering well, Dr Khang insisted I came in for he was really concern about me. I came in and Wendy gave me an IV drip and anti biotics to restore the condition of my health. Everyone could tell I was really weak and showered me love, concern and food.</p>
      <p>Vanessa, even though she isn't the nurse whom I'm directly under, cake around and cracked jokes to lift my spirits up (appreciate ) I felt so much better after the visit.</p>
      <p>For the following 2 weeks during the infection, Dr Kahng scheduled for me to go in every 2 days to monitor my condition. Even though he is a busy man (does 6 surgeries a day my Gosh he is super man ) , he never fails to check in on me and make sure I'm okay progress and health wise. He is a very professional and dutiful surgeon who sincerely takes care of his patients despite his busy schedule.</p>
      <p>[ RESULTS ]</p>
      <p>And so because of my extended downtime unlike normal people, my body was Super swollen in the first 3 weeks into post ops, with the infection and all, I almost thought I couldn't slim down forever * cries*</p>
      <p>But trust me guys rest for your body is so important never take it for granted. When I finally heeded advice and rested in bed for 10 days, my body reduced from XXXL garment to L garment (and going M soon hehe).</p>
      <p>My once swollen af legs are slim as hell and my waist line is actually visible. I have a very nice S shape now. :)</p>
      <p>[ Tip from me as a patient ]</p>
      <p>rest enough (more than enough ), drink water, take your vitamins and protein and wear your garments. You'll look fab in no time. Dr Khang has Superb skills in crafting your body into a beautiful one that you requested for.</p>
      <p>SHOUTOUT 1: for 4 months, Ve my consultant , has never failed to account for my queries and jitters and worries and doubts. I figured she has a very strong communication with Dr Khang and that's the culture there - staff there really communicate and make sure their clients feel accounted for. Thank you ve for putting up with my nonsensical sometimes hysterical whines</p>
      <p>SHOUTOUT 2: Wendy was my designated nurse for day 2 surgery, and also subsequently the nurse whom I was sorta directly under her care. During my suffering of my infection, she was there to take care of me, giving me drips, food and most importantly, companion and support during this crucial period ( I was quite emo lol) thank you Wendy for your constant encouragement and straightforward comments that crack me up all the time.</p>
      <p>SHOUTOUT 3: Lastly, thank you every staff who made me feel like I'm at a home away from home especially during my extended downtime period. It has been great meeting and knowing all of you. I feel sad now that I have to leave LA for home.</p>
      <p>SHOUTOUT 4: Thank you dr Kahng for crafting not only my body but a new journey ahead for me :) I definitely did not make a wrong decision in choosing you as my surgeon - a very, life changing one!</p>

      <p>Laser treatment revlite is awesome. My sunspots have not diminished completely, but have faded which is what they had promised. Totally worth your money. This place seems to not over promise results unlike other clinics. This is the best option you'll find in OC from my experience.</p>

      <p>I was very nervous on the idea of getting a breast augmentation. Even more so, having surgery for the first time ever. However, a BA is something that I've been wanting to do for awhile.I knew I had chosen the perfect location and surgeon the day of my consultation.</p>
      <p>The staff members were so welcoming and attentive. A million thanks to Vanessa for being so informative and making me feel so comfortable throughout the procedure!</p>
      <p>During the consultation, Dr. Kahng was very thorough on all the information I needed to know about the BA. I felt confident about my decision.</p>
      <p>I am on week 2 of having my BA surgery done and I am loving the results so far!! I highly recommend coming here! Thank you Dr. Kahng and staff!</p>

      <p>Dr Kahng is hands down the BEST PLASTIC SURGEON EVER! You may think I am exaggerating but I have been to countless places to get my nose fixed since the first doctor I went to in BH. This is my third time getting it fixed. I was born with my nose a little crooked to the right and I have the somewhat flat asian nose. The first Doctor only raised the height of my nose and the second doctor tried to make my nose straight but it still did not change. I have been in dilemma of even thinking of getting it fix at all, i found Dr Kahng through one of my friend and finally decided to give it a try. I am one month from surgery now everything seems to look great! Im still a swollen here and there, Overall it's a great experience! Im sending all my friends and family here only!! Thank you Dr Kahng and team for the great service!</p>

      <p>I've been contemplating for a nose surgery for a long time, I went to a few places for consultation but decided to go with CARA! Everyone here is so helpful and friendly. During my initial consultation, i was greeted with the front desk lady and was manage to see Dr Kang, other places that i went would just tell me the doctor is not available (which is disappointing, of course i would like to see the Dr that is gonna do my surgery). What makes me more comfortable was that the consultant that was attending me speaks chinese too!! It makes me feel so much more comfortable speaking in my own mother language as I thought everyone here speaks korean/eng only i also do see a few that speaks spanish. Overall, everything went really well I am right now 1 month off my surgery, my swelling and bruising was tolerable and I am really happy with my results!! Dr Kang and his team is the best!</p>

      <p>I have do admit, I was a bit nervous walking into a plastic surgery &amp; laser center. I've always wanted to get laser skin care and some cosmetic surgery done, but never had the time or confidence till now. Making an appointment was super easy (over the phone), and when I walked in the front desk greeted me with a smile. A girl named Vee helped me sign in and I waited all of 3 minutes that it took me to fill out my intake form before they had me in a room for consultation.</p>
      <p>Jasmine was AMAZING. Shes super knowledgeable and answered my 10000000 questions with a smile. Loved the fact that she didn't pressure me into getting a procedure done (I've heard a lot of places try to pressure you into getting expensive procedures you don't need) and gave me completely honest opinions. I was mainly interested in breast augmentation and Asian eyelid surgery. (Who knew there were so many different ways to go about both??) and I was grateful she didn't try to oversell me anything I didn't need. She even talked me out of certain expensive procedures I was thinking of with less dramatic &amp; less invasive procedures.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kahng was also very friendly - I didn't expect to see the doctor during the initial consult but he popped in to make sure I was comfortable and introduced himself before and prepping for his surgery.</p>
      <p>I made an appointment then and there for laser skin care treatment and they were able to schedule me in that week. My laser appointment was done with nurse Sam who also answered all my questions and constantly asked me if I was comfortable during the procedure. I had told him it was my first time and he put me at ease by answering all my questions and periodically checking up on me.</p>
      <p>All in all - I had an amazing experience and I'll be coming back here for my laser hair removal and my other facial surgical procedures for sure! Thanks again CARA!</p>

      <p>To be frankly honest, i've been contemplating on whether or not to get lip fillers for a very long time now. My lips and my breasts have been a huge flaw of mine and I did not know what I can do to make them both the perfect shape I wanted it to be. So, I decided to make an appointment for a consultation with Jasmine on one day and Ve on a different day. They were extremely welcoming and very well spoken. I had so many questions but they calmly answered them with full details making me feel at ease. They both mentioned that customer service will always be Cara Plastic Surgery's number one priority. They're definitely right about that. After the consultations, Jasmine introduced me to Dr. Kahng. He was extremely professional and also very kind. He did not give off this intimidating persona, and did not try to sell me into any other treatments (like most doctors do.) I first heard of Dr. Kahng by this korean website called MissUSA and he was mentioned quite frequently so, i decided to give this place a visit. But, I am definitely glad I did. All in all, both these procedures went very well, I am so happy and relived with them. I will DEFINITELY be recommending my friends in the future! Dr. Kahng, Jasmine and Ve, you guys are the best!!!!!</p>

      <p>I did 3 treatments of RF Secret Microneedling for acne scaring. This helped diminish a lot of the scarring. The procedure itself had some discomfort depending on your pain tolerance. I was numbed twice before every procedure. They also schedule an after care facial a week after every procedure. Alicia is great. She explains everything thoroughly and answers all questions. I also bought their Le Mieux moisturizer which helped with the healing process afterwards. I will be returning for a couple more sessions in the future</p>

      <p>I had a rhinoplasty done by Dr. Kahng two months ago. As someone who's never had any type of surgery prior to this, I was visibly extremely nervous morning of the operation and literally everyone at the surgery center in LA was so accommodating and calming, including the anesthesiologist and Dr. Kahng himself. I truly felt like I was in the best hands possible.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately I forgot the name of the kind woman I had the consultation with, but she was also very helpful and exactly what you would want in a consultant!</p>
      <p>I know everyone's experience differs, but my healing process was very ideal: only 1 very small yellow bruise(didnt even notice until i was in direct sunlight) and little to no pain.. only had to take the prescribed pain meds for two days.</p>
      <p>2 months later and my swelling has gone down so much(I want to say fully but only time will tell) and my results are exactly what I wanted and extremely natural looking! All my friends and family compliment the results and agree that my doctor did an amazing job. I couldn't be any more grateful for the experience I had and my confidence has truly sky rocketed. I know I picked the perfect place to get my operation and I would recommend this center to anyone whether it be for surgery or skin treatments. Thank you so much to everyone at CARA that has helped me along the way!!</p>

      <p>So today i went for my 3month post op for breast augmentation.. I have to say i'm so very happy with my results and the staff / Doctor were amazing. I was always seen by the Dr at my post op appts. I was very scared and stressed after my surgery, but the nurses were amazing especially Vanessa she truly made me feel so comfortable and always reassured me i was going to be okay and Dr. David was the same way, he was always there when i needed to talk to him and over all im loving my new BOOBIES. Thanks to them i am more confident and so happy from the beginning of this Journey till now. I will see them in another 3 months and I will continue to pray that everything stays okay. I would highly recommend them or Dr. David Kahng for surgery, thank you all for being so amazing and so patient with me.</p>

      <p>BA is something I had contemplated for MANY years. When I say MANY I truly mean MANY. I did my research for a long long time until I finally decided to take this big step. To begin, Dr. Kahng has two facilities, this one and the one in Buena Park, which was too far for me so I stayed local. Not the greatest area but the staff is awes ome and so welcoming, plus same amazing doctor.Anyway, Dr. Kahng is simply the best! He is so understanding and knowledgeable, he truly made me feel at ease and comfortable. Surgery is not an easy pill to swallow, but after talking to him I felt so relieved and confident in my decision. He made sure he went over every little detail as far as BA, complications, health related issues, you name it.</p>
      <p>The day of surgery he talked to me a few minutes before to make sure I knew the plan, went over details again, and his staff then prepared me for surgery. Again, everyone there is so friendly! From the nurses to the consultant, Maritza. They really know how to calm your nerves lol.</p>
      <p>It's now been almost 2 weeks since my surgery and I can't say I feel amazing cause honestly who the hell feels amazing after surgery?! But one thing I can say is I feel safe and happy with my decision, and I know it's only a matter of time until I feel great!</p>
      <p>I know I chose the right doctor and staff and I am so thankful they took care of me. I'm still going in for follow ups and every time I'm there, the energy is always positive.</p>

      <p>I have gotten two laser facial treatments here at Cara and I have been extremely pleased with the outcome. This was my first "official" facial treatment and the result has been noticeable within just a couple of days. Dark spots faded away, pores got smaller, and overall skin texture became smooth. Some of my friends have commented that my face just looks more brighter and clear. Also, the nurse who did my treatment was extremely friendly and thorough. She explained what she was doing for each step in the treatment and made sure I was comfortable throughout. I want to definitely come back for more!</p>

      <p>I met Doctor Kahng a few weeks ago when I scheduled a consultation for a BA. From the moment he began talking, I felt very at ease and confident in his knowledge. First, we sat down and he reviewed notes about my goal and my health. Then he went on to examine me and explain what I would need. His demeanor is so professional and I can tell he genuinely is a kind man that truly listens to his clients. I left feeling good about his work. I plan to meet with him soon to see if he can help me achieve my goal.</p>

      <p class="date">7/28/2018</p>
      <p>I have an issue with this place. Cara has introduced to me the skewed delusion that continued self-betterment through cosmetic surgery is a FABULOUS idea! Anyhoo-</p>
      <p><b>STAFF:</b></p>
      <p>The nurses and administrative staff here are REAL people- not walking advertisements for Cara's services. They're friendly and will never make you feel rushed or pressured. They have each accommodated me beyond my expectations and I look forward to seeing them when I visit. The atmosphere is pretty candid and they're definitely not trained with any pre-scripted information, but I feel like this practice is more honest in that way. I've been to a lot of places where the ladies recite medical advice to me in such a fluid manner, that you know they say the same spiel to everyone. It's not like that here- In fact, it's a little unrefined. If they don't know something, you can tell... they'll pause and go ask the doctor. But I love this about them. They earned my business, really.</p>
      <p><b>KAHNG:</b></p>
      <p>In the end, the deciding factor is the doctor. He's aged a little bit (and rather well!) from the video you see here on yelp, which is great, ladies and gents. Means he's seasoned. He's kind, gentle, soft spoken, and he doesn't smile a lot with his mouth but you can feel him smiling through his eyes. He possesses zero percentage of ad-man demeanor and you needn't question the integrity of his words- why? Honestly, I don't know. he just feels like a really decent fellow, and I feel safe in his hands. My only complaint- which I know is slightly unreasonable, is that I would have liked a little more face time with him. (But this is normal. It's like this everywhere. I totally get it. doctors are busy.)</p>
      <p><b>FACILITY:</b></p>
      <p>Clean. Water, coffee, tea, and candy in the front. Not many frills. (who needs them) Parking in the back. Convenient Pharmacy next door. Purple... walls..? lol</p>
      <p><b>CONSULTATION:</b></p>
      <p>Free, easy to get an appointment. I did get to meet the doctor. They don't pressure you or try make you to sign off that day, like some other places. Write down your questions before-hand. Take photo examples of what you're going for. The conversation goes much smoother that way, I've found.</p>
      <p><b>SUPPORT:</b></p>
      <p>Text support! Jasmine was mine. I was a nervous wreck for the whole month before surgery and even after. Every question I had to ask, jasmine was there to answer, and in a timely manner. A woman named Vi helped me get the proper doctor's notes for work, and I poked and prodded these poor ladies so much, but they never lost their patience with me and helped me both emotionally and logistically.</p>
      <p><b>PRICE:</b></p>
      <p>Not the cheapest you'll find in K-town, but who wants that?? It was very fairly priced. For me, a serious bargain for the experience, the results so far, and mostly for the peace of mind these people have given me the past couple of months. (I got 6 consults/quotes in total and Cara was somewhere in the middle) That being said, I also got multiple procedures done at once and got a great deal because of it.</p>
      <p><b>PROCEDURES:</b></p>
      <p>Breast Augmentation, Upper-arm Liposuction, Axillary (Armpit) Liposuction, Accusculpt for the Chin.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>The anesthesiologist was also a really friendly fellow. Seemed experienced.</p>
      <p>Surgery was very easy. I had to go under general, so I remember nothing. Zilch. Sorry.</p>
      <p><b>-OP CARE:</b></p>
      <p>Recovery from any surgery sucks, really, but again, there was plenty of text support, and with each post-op visit, the staff and Dr. Kahng took great care of me. They don't say all that much and are not nazi's with a million rules for you to follow, so I took it upon myself to do lots of research, ask lots of questions, and to... use common sense.</p>
      <p><b>RESULTS:</b></p>
      <p>So far, everything is looking really great, even with the swelling. Comparatively to similar procedures I've had with other doctors, my recovery is a lot "cleaner" and faster.</p>
      <p>It's only been 3 weeks, so I will update my review when I see more change.</p>

      <p>I'm caring myself a lot, and also my skin is really sensitive. I was looking for hospitals or clinics for skin lasers. I found a good place to get skin treatment in Los Angeles, the place is called CARA PLASTIC SURGERY CENTER. This place is really clean and the staffs are very friendly which is I liked that. One of staffs, Jasmin introduced me a new laser to improve my skin. She was very nice to me. Jasmin explained about the laser to me that the laser machine helps to reduce the freckles and wrinkles and also helps improve skin tone. It is upgraded toning laser. I researched this laser machine and it has good review from other people who had this treatments. I decided to get the package of this laser treatment because the package is cheaper than receiving treatment for 1time. The laser machine is called Revlite. I received this treatment from the nurse and aftercare of skincare. When I was getting it, it wasn't as painful as I think. I felt very comfortable and relax. I had experiences of having treatments of lasers before. Honestly, I wasn't satisfied the results. Now I'm really happy with the result by receiving this treatment. I recommend other people who look for a good place for lasers like me!</p>

      <p>I have been getting revlite treatment here for my sun damage (despite slathering sunscreen multiple times a day) and they have been great! My dark spots are lightening up (these aren't cute freckles we're talking about, these are big splotches on my face). After trying to unsuccessfully treat this with hydroquinone, acid peels, obagi system etc etc. this place is a godsend.</p>
      <p>Also, all the techs speak both Korean and English so that's been helpful- both from a language perspective and their knowledge of Asian skin (more susceptible to both hypo and hyper pigmentation, skin tone, etc).</p>
      <p>I highly highly recommend Cara. Just a tip, try to schedule your appointments a few weeks in advance and they book up fairly quickly</p>

      <p>I had my rhinoplasty done with doctor Kahng almost 2 years ago. I wanted to wait until it completely healed before I write a review. I had swelling for many months because I had a lot of work done on the nose tip.</p>
      <p>I went for consultation in Buena Park but the surgery was scheduled at the center in Los Angeles. Parking was good, the anesthesiologist was very calming. The first week was dreadful because I had to breath out of my mouth. My nose was very swollen and oily for a couple of months. I think everyone's body heal a little differently but it took me months before I was confident about my nose. The tip swelling really took a long time to resolve. I would suggest don't get it done too close to any important event. Especially if you want to get tip work done. Any swelling with the bridge of the nose seems to resolve a lot faster.</p>
      <p>At about a year after the surgery, all of my swelling finally went away. I was so happy with the result. He did an amazing job and I loved it. After the swelling went away, the result is so natural. All of my friends agreed that he did a great job.</p>
      <p>His office staffs are friendly and helpful. The price they offered here is reasonable for the quality of work that the doctor deliver!</p>

      <p>Dr Kahng eludes this style of poised fashion, basically this impression I get everytime I see him. Him and his glasses haha! He answers all of my (and mother) questions in an honest, informative and re- assuring way (all qualities that make a stellar doctor.) What I like about him, he's not one to sell certain products or introduce another procedure to get more money out of you. Plus he has this gentle- reassuring persona (I think it's his hands) but I have to be honest I wish I had more of a relationship with him, I mostly talk to his staff for pre and post op questions. He's a pretty talented doctor equating to a very busy practice but he has a very solid team, extremely friendly and helpful staff.</p>
      <p>Jasmine has helped me tremendously with all of my anxiety driven questions and even called numerous times to check up on me AND on top of that, ask to reschedule so she could look at me personally while she's in. Shoutout to Vanessa who is the nurse assisting Dr. D, she's pretty and nice but mainly so funny especially when you're nervous day of surgery.</p>
      <p>I'm about two- weeks post op from Breast Augmentation and Flank liposuction and so far I love them. I'm still swollen/ tingly from Lipo but that's common. Almost full recovery with my breast (apparently I'm still swollen in the chest but I can't tell), scars healing well, no pain and no arm extension limitations. I have another appointment tomorrow so if anything happens I'll update the review but so far everything has been smooth and I loved my experience with Dr D and his staff! I've already recommended to a couple friends and considering other procedures.</p>

      <p>I went to other doctors before deciding to have my reconstructive surgeries done here. Dr. K is awesome! He's very kind, caring, and patient! I instantly felt at ease with him. He helped to calm my anxiety and answered my many questions. I had two major surgeries done by him. I am very happy with the results. He is such a professional and great doctor!&nbsp; The nurses are also amazing! Vanessa and Wendy are so sweet and helpful. Anytime I come in I always find myself laughing with Vanessa. Wendy was so caring and nice after I woke up from surgery.&nbsp; I highly recommend getting a consultation here!</p>

      <p>I am so grateful to have gotten my surgery with Dr. Kahng. Many people don't like to admit that they've gotten surgery, but I think Dr. Kahng did such a great job that he deserves a good and honest review (with pictures) about his capabilities as a surgeon. Also, I want others who are interested in getting double eyelid surgery to feel comfortable when choosing Dr. Kahng. I know I was a bit uncertain because he did not have many pictures published for upper bleph on his website/yelp.</p>
      <p>Anyways, here it goes. I went in for upper bleph and I am completely satisfied with the results. The results are very natural while also noticeably different from what my eyes looked like before. I already had a slight double eyelid that was very small and formed when I was about 15 years old, but over time it had gotten very weak and I became unsatisfied with the way my eyes looked. I got tired of people telling me that I don't need it and to just be happy with the way I looked. So, this past August, I finally opted to get the surgery.</p>
      <p>I'm so glad that I chose Dr. Kahng. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and answered all my questions when I got nervous about my surgery. Dr. Kahng was kind and professional and has a very gentle and comforting demeanor. I immediately felt reassured and that my eyes were in good hands with Dr. Kahng.</p>
      <p>I opted for the 3 point suture, or "anchor" method and a 9 mm crease. It's a bit more secure as a method compared to the suture method and a lot less down time than full incision. Dr. Kahng did tell me that there is a possibility of suture failure with the anchor method, but I chose it anyways because it was my first surgery and I didn't want something irreversible either in case I didn't like it. I was lucky in that my eyes did not swell as much as most people do. Much of the swelling had already gone down by one week post op and by two weeks post op, they looked completely natural. It's been about 6 weeks since I got it and the scars are still healing but the swelling has pretty much completely gone down already and my eyes look very natural, as you can see in the pictures. The progression picture from top to bottom is, day of surgery, 5 days post op, 1 week post op, and 5 weeks or a little over a month post op. All of the progress pictures were taken without any makeup except for the last one, but I was only wearing mascara.</p>
      <p>I hope this helps anyone who is interested in getting double eyelid surgery but is unsure of who to choose! Feel free to contact me about my surgery/surgery experience. I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>

      <p>I was honestly shocked by the incredible capabilities of Dr. Kahng. I came in for Asian upper bleph a few months ago. I knew once I had the procedure, it would be on my face for life so I was really anxious about choosing the right doctor who could give me the results I wanted. Within the constraints of the procedure itself (will not make eye size bigger, will not correct for unevenness naturally found in eyes), Dr, Kahng was able to give me the exact results I wanted with only a few reference photos I provided and an initial consultation.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>His staff is very willing to help answer any questions you have prior to or before surgery. I definitely suggest sticking to the millimeter height (specific to upper bleph) Dr. Kahng recommends for your eyes. He recommended 9 mm for me, which at first I had huge doubts about because I thought it would be too high, but after a few months and some reduction of swelling, I found was the perfect natural crease height for my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Recovery went really fast for me. I was ready to go out in public comfortably in 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Overall experience was great. I can't imagine getting better results if I went to any other clinic.</p>

      <p>My 5-star rating is a bit misleading because I didn't actually get any procedures done here, but I did get honesty. I went because I have a small bit of extra skin under my chin that I wanted tighter. I was told that because my problem was so small and because there wasn't really any fat, I would likely not be happy with the results from the injections or from the ultherapy tightening, so it would be best to wait a few years. I really appreciate when doctors, especially ones that make money off of playing up your problems, are honest like that.&nbsp; The waiting room is really nice as are the people working the front desk.</p>

      <p>I've had a lot of trouble with hypertrophic scaring on my face for several years. I have taking many types of medical both oral and injection and even tried laser surgery but nothing worked. Surgery was my last hope. I went to another doctor and he told me that there was nothing he could do, but we decided to get one last opinion and that was Dr. Khang. He was the only doctor that was able to identify my diagnoses and treat them correctly. After a few surgery and several injection, I have seen drastic improvement then I have with years with other doctors. I come al the way from Vegas to see Dr. Khang for treatment and the only doctor I will come to.&nbsp; Thanks you Dr Khang and your wonderful for all the help that you have given me!!</p>

      <p>This place is great! I did the toning laser for my freckles and it works so well. It almost disappear after 5 sessions. The nurses and staffs are super nice and professional! It is something you definitely want to go for if you don't like your freckles. Besides, the side benefits of doing this is the pores on my face got smaller! The skin tone is better than before.</p>

      <p>I found Dr. Kahng when I was in the plaza that his office is in. I've been wanting to get my eyes redone since the first procedure was a total failure (different doctor; I wrote a review about them as well). I looked at his reviews and called in to schedule a consult. I'm pretty traumatized from my first procedure so I was sure to have all my questions and concerns ready.&nbsp; Went in and met with the consultant, Marie. She was so kind and informative! (I even called a few times after my consult with questions I thought if after the fact and she was still happy to answer my questions and never became short with me like some people can.) I then met with Dr. Kahng and after speaking with him, I was sold. This was the doctor I wanted to work with. So he took some labs and I scheduled my appointment!&nbsp; The surgery itself was such a pleasant experience. His whole team is amazing. Compared to my first experience with the other doctor, this was the rolls royce of surgical experiences. Even after, I had no pain! Got my stitches out yesterday and I love the outcome. Still a bit of swelling which is normal so I'll be posting a photo later. I highly recommend Dr. Kahng and his team to anyone who has anxiety about going under the knife.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

      <p>Dr.David Kahng and his staff are GREAT. I recently got my tummy tuck and breast augmentation done in March 2016. I'm currently 8 weeks post op. Dr.Kahng is very caring for his patient health, and he listens what the patient wants. However he is also very honest giving his opinion for the procedure you select. He will definitely not push you to get something done if you don't really need it. He was my 6th consultation I went to and he was the only one that mentioned not to get lipo done, because in his opinion I was not going to get enough blood supply. Prior to surgery I was a small frame body 5'2'' 120lb. A tummy tuck is all I needed + breast augmentation. His staff is great and caring as well. By the way the nurse that works with him Vanessa she is AWESOME!!!. After my surgery I had a lot of questions and concerns, she was the person to contact every day. In 2 weeks I'll be getting my botox done at Dr.Kahng office. &nbsp;If anyone needs to get any cosmetic surgery done Dr. Kahng is GREAT!!!!! I will definitely recommend &nbsp;this doctor.</p>

      <p>I am a mom of three and working. I've done Breast augmentation here a month ago. Of course the result was fantastic. The journy through this whole process was very easy and ordely because of friendly staff. Especially operation room in LA was just perfect!! It was no different than a big hospital. Quality of care was exceptional. Clean.Dr.Kahng was very professional and detailed oriented. I am so glad that I found this &nbsp;place. I am so confident to refer this place to my friends and family.</p>

      <p>I'm a surgeon so I can say with absolute confidence that Dr. David Kahng is the only Plastic Surgeon I would send my family, friends or patients to.</p>
      <p>I realized how scary it is out there with non-board certified physicians doing plastic surgery procedures. Just look in the back of any LA Weekly magazine, really concerning. I have now sent family and friends to Dr. Kahng who treated them with the utmost respect and caring. He is an excellent surgeon who treats all his patients as though they were his own family.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kahng was a great surgeon when I knew him during training and he went on to the University of Massachusetts to do two more years of training in plastic surgery. As a board certified Plastic Surgeon from 2008-2018 he is very capable of performing a wide variety of plastic surgery procedures with the necessary confidence and skill.</p>
      <p>So if your looking for a superb Plastic Surgeon, look no further, Dr. Kahng is fantastic. His office is really nice and his staff is very friendly and always willing to help. Overall an EXCELLENT practice !!</p>

    <p class="border-top">Dr. Kahng did my breast aug. an I think I went a little too big which he warned me about lol but I did what I wanted anyways ! He did an amazing job I think I will be downsizing in the future lol . I went to Brand Surgical in Glendale and he was the operating doctor at the time. I know they change or rotate doctors so it's always someone new. At the time I was there in 2015 I believe ... he was the plastic surgeon there and he was so nice and gave me so much good information. Truly he is a great surgeon. I wanted big boobs since I was a deflated C at the time. I had deflated breast from breast feeding my daughter and wanted to look youthful since at the time I was only 22 years old. (25 now) He advised me what I wanted and what I thought were two totally different things and boy was he right lol. I imagined perky breast that was a nice pronounced size but he advised me that every ones breast are different so what I envisioned was not the results I was going to get. I imagined a D on me would fit right but what I was asking for was more. AND thats exactly what happened .... I came out with a DDD. I'm 5'0 1/2 so they look hugeeee! but I love them and so does my other. the pain was horrible for the first week but I'm a working mother so I went to work 3 days after surgery but I was not allowed to do any lifting or answer phones just desk work. I do not regret it one bit they are gorgeous a bit huge lol but beauty I currently asked for my before since I only have my afters ... so stay posted on photos *** NOT SURE HIS PRICES, I DID GO THRU B.S.I AND I PAID CASH SO IT WAS</p>

    <p class="border-top">Thank you Dr. Kahng. You are the best. I don't know how to appreciate my thanks to Dr. Kahng. I got a call from my 3 4 year- old daughter's preschool that she fell from the playstructure and wounded her forehead. That was around 4:30 in the afternoon. In complete panic, I called all plastic surgeon's office in LA, explained my daughter's situation in detail and also that it will be at least an hour drive from where we were. One of the office made an appointment for me to come. So I drove, with my daughter whose blood was still oozing out from the wound, all the way to LA through the traffic only to be told that the doctor has already left for the day and so she cannot be seen. How irresponsible and how uncaring! So worried and frustrated, I called every single plastic surgeon's office in LA and around my house. It was already past 6 pm. Dr. Kahng's office was the only office that let me speak to the doctor directly, who kindly explained to me that a facial cut or tear has a longer time window for repair and that he would make himself available only to see my daughter at 7 am the next morning since he will be in surgery till 9 that night. I cannot tell you how grateful and relieved I was. So we came home had short sleep and went back to his office at 7 am, where Dr. Kahng and two nurses were already all prepared and ready to greet my daughter. They were so kind and friendly to her that my daughter felt so comfortable all throughout the stitching process. She did not cry nor express any discomfort or fear at all. They played Disney music for her and I could tell how cautiously and meticulously Dr. Kahng was carrying out the process. Being a doctor of different field myself, I knew that he was working on her with sincere heart as if he was treating his own daughter. I could not ask for more. He was just so great and the best. The way his team treated and prepared my daughter made me feel very confident that these are very very experienced people that knows and excels in what they are doing. I am planning to come back to his office for my needs as well. Thank you Dr Kahng on behalf of my whole family!</p>
