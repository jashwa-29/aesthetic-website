                            <p>A friend recommended Cara for laser treatments and injections. I hesitated at first because I was looking to get some light treatments at a Med Spa, and Cara was a Plastic Surgery Center. However, I'm so glad I gave it a try! The staff was well trained and professional. The office was clean and orderly. The staff never tried to upsell me and was informative about the treatment. Even when I asked about other treatments, they were honest about whether I was a good candidate or not. With a AAA quality and service, Cara even offered budget-friendly promotions. Why go to a Med Spa when I can get surgical-center-quality treatments that is competitively priced? It's a win-win for sure. I highly recommend.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Kahng is truly the best there is! I had my rhinoplasty done at Cara Plastic Surgery in Los Angeles, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome! Dr. Kahng and his team were fantastic from day one. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, addressed all my questions, and really understood the look I was going for. The surgery itself went smoothly, and the recovery process was surprisingly easy. The results are exactly what I hoped for--natural and perfectly suited to my face. It has made such a positive impact on my confidence. I'm already considering scheduling a breast augmentation with Dr. Kahng in the near future because I trust his expertise completely. If you're looking for a skilled surgeon with a caring team, I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery! Will be coming back soon!</p>

I am extremely happy with my results. Dr. Kahng took his time explaining the procedure to me and what to expect. He has such good bedside manners. Dr has an amazing staff and all very helpful. Perfection and professionalism is so important and this LA office definitely has that. Thank you all for taking such good care of me.</p>

I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery for anyone looking for top-notch care and results.</p>

                            <p>My first time to the clinic and first time doing the laser toning. I have hyperpigmentation issues and was looking for a mild procedure so that I can go to work the next day without any redness. Nurse Jennifer was very attentive to my needs and provided thorough explanation of how gentle the treatment would be on my skin. I signed up for 10 sessions and started to see the improvement after my fourth visit. The dark areas became lighter and brightened up my overall skin tone though I didn't see much improvement with the fine lines. I'm considering another 10 sessions this fall and will post a review of the results. And get an appt with Grace for facials. She's one of the best!</p>

The staff at Cara were so welcoming and made me feel right at home. After just one session, I could see a noticeable improvement in my skin's texture and tone. I'm really excited to see the results after my next two sessions. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Cara, and I'm very satisfied with the results. Cannot wait for my next appointment!

                            <p>Nurse Jennifer works magic with the Genesis laser! She was recommended to me by my mum (who received the toning laser treatment and I'm sooo happy I went! For context, I'm in my 30's, combination skin, Asian descent. I have lots of light acne scars, redness/rosacea (cheeks), uneven pigmentation, larger pores (nose/cheeks), etc. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Jennifer worked magic! I could tell the difference after just one session, and I couldn't wait for my second. (I got a package of 5 sessions.) She was really kind, thorough, answered all the questions I had before started, and made sure I was comfortable. I literally got compliments on my skin the first week after my treatment! Everything seems brighter, healthier, and more glowy. (I am already budgeting for my next bundle lol) They even provide full, 1-hour long facial afterwards!</p>

                            <p>It's a must for this Center. From the front staff to the nurses to the doctor. I went in for filler (Sculptra) for the first time ever. I was greeted by the front office and then spoke to a consultant named Theresa who then referred me to nurse Julianna. Being my face, I was a little anxious but once Julianna informed me what Sculptra is for and gave me her recommendation, I was all in. Julianna made it so comfortable and answered all my questions. She even noticed I had a lot more volume loss on one side of my face and explained how much I needed and informed me exactly how many cc I would need so my face so it would be even. As soon and she finished, I saw the results immediately. I was so impressed by the change right away. She explained the aftercare and I was so extremely satisfied that I asked if I could add a lip flip. She was very sweet and checked with the front office to make sure my appointment did not over Lap with another. I was able to get my lip flip. I have even made an appointment to come back and discuss additional treatments/ surgeries with Theresa, the consultant. I can't wait to make my next appointment. Thank you Cara for making my Cara (face) look much younger.</p>

                            <p>Where do I begin with my experience with Dr. Kahng?! I had a facelift by him like a little over week ago and I cannot believe how great it already looks!!! He must have a gentle hand because I healed very quickly with very little bruising. I chose him because I was really impressed with his before/ after pictures. He really understands our Asian facial anatomy and has a keen eye to beautify it. I am beyond happy to look in the mirror and see myself as young as I feel. I feel so confident and happy with the way I look now. Julie was the consultant that helped me through the whole process. She made me feel comfortable and confident through it all. She reassured me that everything was going to be fantastic and if I had any questions, she was only a phone call or text away. And I tested her patience many time with lots of stupid questions and she never batted an eye. She replied back and answered all my annoying questions. I hope Dr Kahng realizes what a gem he has. All the nurses were wonderful and this will forever be my place for future procedures. If you are looking for a brilliant surgeon, amazing staff and very reasonable pricing look no further!!! From the very bottom of my heart.... Thank you thank you thank you!!! I am over the moon with my results !!!!</p>

                            <p>I'm doing another review according to how the actual surgery procedure went. So, I ended up deciding to have a surgery procedure done here. The entire process was smooth. All staff that helped me with the process were considerate, kind, and very knowledgable. They eased my nerves before the operation. When I had the consultation with the doctor before the operation and the check up with the doctor after the operation, the doctor proved to show what a great doctor he is. He was articulate in communicating the complications of my case and explained all things well, even during the recovery process of the operation. I trust him if I was to have any more procedures done in the future. Finally, he helped resolve and fix the complications that arose from a previous dissatisfied surgery procedure with another plastic surgeon. That's what mattered the most. Thus, I consider Dr. Kahng to be an intelligent plastic surgeon.</p>

                            <p>Please trust me when I say they are AMAZING! The first time I went was for Botox, was with Vanessa. She was very understanding and not pushy at all (I've had experiences in different locations where they just wanted money instead of my happiness) I got Botox on my forehead and felt so comfortable and extremely happy with my results. While there I asked about fillers for my smile lines and lip filler, which they offer this service, I booked my appointment with Juliana. I was extremely nervous because I had never done fillers. Upon my arrival they were very sweet and patient with me, explained everything and began the numbing process. Juliana was very conservative with how much I should get, that's exactly what I wanted. I did NOT FEEL A THING!! the process was no more than 30-45 min and I am OBSESSED WITH MY FACE!!! They have a customer for life with me! I can't stop looking at myself you will not be disappointed!</p>

I had my eyelids done couple years ago with Dr. Kahng and was very pleased with the results. Couple months back, I decided to do a neck and facelift surgery. I consulted with Dr. Kahng and went under operation. After about 3 months, I can't be happier! I am very happy with the results and once again I can look myself in the mirror again:-) Julie, was my consultant and she was awesome. She walked me through all steps of surgery and post- operations expectations.Overall, Cara Plastic Surgery team was awesome. Everyone at the office is friendly and professional. Dr. Kahng has superb bedside manner. I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery for all your cosmetic needs.</p>

                            <p>I took my husband to Cara for his deep acne scars on face that he had since his teenage years. After counseling he was recommended to do multiple rounds of Secret microneedling for his acne scars. Chemical peel was not something we wanted to try due to its harshness, side effects and long healing time so we were happy to hear about the Secret needling. After each treatment his face was initially red for the first 2-3 days then it got better after that. His acne scars began to lighten noticeably after 2-3 session starting from his forehead and nose. We then extended for another rounds of the Secret needling. Now his overall complexion is cleaner and smoother than before! My husband hates needles and anything painful but the nursing staff here really made each session doable for him. He also noticed the small improvements after each session so he actually wanted to go back for more!! I also get my facials here as well. It is a great deal if you get the package for discount or use one of their monthly specials. I highly recommend you to give this place a try!</p>

I went to him to have botched chin implant/augmentation/removal procedures that I had done with Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. I'm waiting to see if the result(s) here turn out better than Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. Thus far, they treated me with great customer service. Dr. Kahng says he could try improving what's already done to me, and for that, I thank him. It gives me hope there's a plastic surgeon out there who can do a good job.</p>

                            <p>Procedure: mommy makeover on 6/6/23. Can I just say I love this place. From the front desk to the nurses to the anesthesiologist to the doctor. Everyone there is so beyond professional and welcoming it has made this whole experience so much better. The office is always clean and put together. The front desk is so welcoming and friendly. I was assigned Maritza as my coordinator and I can't say enough good things about her. She has been there for me from the very beginning. From answering all my questions to helping me with the financial side of it to even answering me on her days off. She is just absolutely amazing! The nurses Vanessa and Jocelyn just wow. They make everything just so much better. Their knowledge and kindness is something I won't forget. They make me feel so at ease while at the same time keeping it real with how things are going to feel and what to expect. They don't seem to get annoyed when I flinch or ask to many questions. Sorry ladies. Now the day of the procedure. I was so nervous. I was really trying to keep myself calm. The nurse I had (which I wish I could remember her name) was fantastic! She kept me so calm with her jokes and her calm demeanor. Literally the absolute best! Even her aftercare which I remember some of. I remember her just being there for me and very attentive. The anesthesiologist Dr. Ye is a great one to. So informative and really took the best care of me. I felt sick waking up but once they gave me medicine for it I was perfectly fine. He did fantastic. Shoutout to the OR tech also because they don't get enough shoutouts. Finally Dr. Kahng. He is great. I love how calm and relaxed he is. I told him how I wanted to look natural and not have big breast implants. They are still swollen but I'm so happy with the results so far. He really took what I said and listened. There are really not enough words to express my gratitude to each and everyone at this office who made this process so smooth and easy. I would recommend you guys over and over again.</p>

                            <p>I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr. David Kahng! One year post op (breast aug) and I am beyond satisfied with my results. I sought many consultations before deciding to move forward with this procedure and that was in large part after seeing Dr. Kahng and learning everything I needed to know about the process. All of my questions were answered, I felt so comfortable from start to finish, and I felt very in control and in the loop with everything big to small. You need to have trust and good communication for a surgery like this and they knocked it out of the park. Also... JULIE! She is the best, she made me feel like an absolute queen the entire year long journey. So kind, sweet and caring - actually this goes for the entire staff! Everyone was always so helpful and welcoming. There is a lot that goes into this procedure - many pre op appointments, post op care, and follow ups through the first year of recovery. Honestly any time I had to go in for a check up or appointment, I looked forward to it! I knew it would be a good experience. Best of luck to anyone considering this journey - I am so glad I did and with CARA / Dr. Kahng!</p>

                            <p>Cara is definitely my ultimate place to go for my beauty enhancements. The office is super clean, the staff is very welcoming and friendly. As well as all the nurses in the office. Nurse Vanessa did an amazing job on my lips she's been doing my lips for the past 3 years including my Botox. I love that she is very self explanatory with every step that she is doing, very clean and most important professional and knowledgeable with the face anatomy. I know I chose the right place. Thank you everyone at Cara. Can't wait for dr kahng to do my BBL.</p>

                            <p>People have been asking about my experience with dr. kahng, so i thought i would just post about it. My experience was super smooth, throughout the whole process. everyone at the clinic was super nice (julie was my consultant, love her), including the doctor himself. he holds himself with a quiet confidence, and was clear and honest about what my expectations should be. just overall a very pleasant person. Surgery day came and i was NERVOUS but the nurses were so kind and made sure to ask if i had any questions. almost 3 hrs later, i was wheeled out to the car. after the 30 min drive home, i was ready to walk around and talk. there was no pain throughout the healing process-- at least in my experience. the first night was the most unpleasant, because i had to get used to breathing through my mouth. but after 2 days, i could stop using a drip pad, and halfway through the first week they had me come in for a gentle cleaning. you do not do any of the cleaning yourself!!! no peroxide, no saline, only water and q-tips for blood that dried outside the nose. they will do the cleaning for you. i got it cleaned 3 days post, 1 week post, and 2 weeks post. I did not have any significant swelling or bruising after the surgery. obviously, my nose is swollen, but i didn't look like i had two black eyes at any point. no one at the clinic seemed surprised at this-- i truly think dr. kahng is just hella good at his job. The full cost included anesthesia and post surgery visits, which i was glad to hear. (AND A STEROID SHOT they give u in the first week post op!) my swelling is going down slowly but surely! even though i'm only a couple weeks out, i'm still very pleased with the results (i got the bridge shaved, the sides slimmed, and cartilage added to the tip (he uses donor cartilage)). Overall, i can't recommend him enough, especially for asian clients. :)</p>

                            <p>I had 3 surgeries done with Dr. David Kahng. My health journey started when I decided to change my life 6 years ago and live healthier. I have change my mind to live happier and peaceful which has ultimately affected my physique, I had lost the volume of my breast and had a lot of loose skin on my stomach. I decided to get treatment to complete my transformation. The first thing that I would like to talk about is the vibe of the office, everybody was very sweet and professional. I would like to give a shout out to Maritza that helped me through the consultation process and Vanessa the beautiful nurse that helped me with my pre op and post op. Even after my procedure they were standing by through my healing process. Dr. Kahng did a wonderful job on my Breast, tummy tuck and my nose! I highly recommend anybody that would like to enhance their body. Thank you Dr. Kahng and all the beautiful team</p>

                            <p>I was kind of nervous coming here but came in on my friends recommendation and I think I've found my go to spot for all things beauty! The waiting room is clean and I didn't have to wait long at all (maybe 10-15 min). My consultant, Julie, was super helpful/insightful and made sure to answer every one of my billion questions (I brought a list). I especially appreciated that she didn't just try to sell me every package that they had and even talked me out of things that I thought I needed. My nurse's name was Alice (I think) and she was just as amazing. I was really nervous at first but she was able to calm me down by explaining everything. I got the skin booster treatment and Botox. It's only been a week and I can already see the results!</p>

                            <p>I found Dr. David Kahng through a friend who had a lot of positive words to say about him. I was tempted to get rhinoplasty for over a decade. I flu from New York for consultation and after having the meeting I was more at ease. Dr. Kahng did an amazing job during my consultation answering every question and I left. He explained in detail what he can do and I showed what I want my new nose to look like. It has been only two months and I can definitely see that he's done a great job and he did exactly as promised and I'm very happy with the result. Given it will look even better few months down the road. His team of nurses were very attentive and helpful at every step. The medical facility is very clean and a professional environment. The recovery was short for me and painless. All my questions and concerns were answered in a timely fashion, I was never rushed at any time and my results are amazing. I'm glad I made the trek to Los Angeles and very happy when I look in the mirror. I'm very thankful to Dr. Kahng and I hope he helps more women/men to feel and look even more confident. I was extremely satisfied with the professionalism of the staff. Dr. Kahng is an exceptional surgeon whom I would highly recommend to anyone!</p>

Second time coming here for botox, and didn't feel pressured to get more than I wanted. Suggestions were made, but my decision was respected and followed through. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend this clinic for your cosmetic needs!  It's super clean. I've had a different nurse both times, and both were nice. Vanessa and Alice.</p>

He was already known from Korean community in Los Angeles that he is good at rhinoplasty, so I trusted him already. After a consultation with him, I trusted him more and now I'm happy with my new look. I only regret that I didn't get it done sooner! Every staff was super friendly and welcoming also.

                            <p>I have been coming to CARA center since Early June and I have to say that it has been a game changer for my skin. My skin has significantly improved, my face is more toned, my skin is hydrated, my skin is glowing, my hyperpigmentation has decreased. I had a series of Miin lasers and facials and rejuran injection. Before my treatments I was experiencing severe dryness and dullness but these treatments have significantly helped. CARA staff, Vee, nurse Umi, nurse Alice, nurse heather & the aesthetician have been extremely professional and experts. Believe me when I say I have severe trust issues when it comes to trusting places/people especially to treat my face. But this place was highly recommend and they have really exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend them.</p>

I never regret one thing about my rhinoplasty, I just wish I would have done it sooner. I got so many compliments on my nose as I refer them to Doctor. As a girl, being pretty is something we all want. When we look good, we feel good. The new look I have completely change my self-esteem. I became so much more confident and love myself even more.

                            <p>I recent have my Rhinoplasty here with Doctor Kahng... I love my new nose each n every day since I did it over one month ago... I'm glad I found the best doctor who is very very extreme gentle and I got so many compliments from friends, coworkers & relative that my new nose look extreme natural, and also it helps my face look longer and less rounded... best thing is that I love the result which I did not expect it...Also, thumb up to miss Julie, she keep checking on me after the surgery to make sure everything went well...in near future, if I have any other plans for cosmetic improvements, I would definitely choose doctor Kahng...</p>

                            <p>Hi here's an update on fully healed eyelids! My right eye is naturally smaller than my left eye and has more skin/fat on the lid, so after the surgery, the asymmetry is still present. I feel like suture method isn't as good as the surgical method at correcting asymmetry, but who knows. But I'm loving the results, it's been two years post op and I love how they've healed! It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want a big lid, I wanted a natural lid to maintain the mono lid look a little bit. This is what I told Dr. kahng and I think he did great to honor my preference. Be sure to tell him what you want!!</p>

Now looking at my new nose I fall in love with it every single day. My doctor was very kind, I barely had any bruises and minimal pain. He constantly schedule me for a check up to see how I'm doing with my nose. All the staffs are friendly and informative , and I highly recommend this place</p>
